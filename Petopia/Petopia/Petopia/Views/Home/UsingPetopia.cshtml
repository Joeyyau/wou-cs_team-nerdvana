                                And Pet Care Providers -- don't forget to leave good
                                end-of-visit notes after each Pet Care Appointment!
                                Not only does the Pet Owner appreciate it, but they can
                                be helpful the next time you care for this Pet -- and
                                are accessible to future Pet Care Providers who may care

                                    our purpose.

                                    the selling of pets through our site.

                                    We are not saying there is anything wrong with

                                    breeder -- however it would be impossible for us to
                                    vet (no pun intended) everyone -- and it is outside
                                    of the scope we want to be involved in.
